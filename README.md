# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Task Management App

## Overview

This is a task management application that allows users to manage their tasks by adding, editing, deleting, and marking them as completed or ongoing. The application provides features like drag-and-drop functionality for organizing tasks, a search bar for filtering tasks by title, and a dropdown menu to filter tasks by category (Work, Personal, Urgent, or All). The app also integrates a mock JSON server as a backend to store and manage task data.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed or ongoing.
- **Drag-and-Drop Functionality**: Organize tasks in a drag-and-drop interface using `react-beautiful-dnd`.
- **Search and Filter**: Search tasks by title and filter them by category (Work, Personal, Urgent, or All).
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and works on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Edit Modal**: A modal popup to edit task details (title, description, category).
- **Mock Backend**: The app uses a mock JSON server as the backend to simulate real API interactions.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - React.js (with functional components and hooks)
  - Tailwind CSS (for styling)
  - Axios (for API calls)
  - React Router (for navigation)
  - React Beautiful DnD (for drag-and-drop functionality)
  
- **Backend**:
  - Mock JSON Server (to simulate backend API)

- **Development Tools**:
  - Node.js
  - npm (or yarn)

## Instructions to Set Up and Run the App Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https:https://github.com/descmd1/task-manager-assessment.git
   cd task-management-app
   
## Install
 - run npm install to install the dependencies

 - run npm install -g json-server to access the backend

 - json-server --watch db.json --port 3001  to start the backend

 - run npm start to start the project.
